#Law of Large Numbers Python 

We have a six sided dice with values (1-6). What's the probability of rolling an even value? 

E[Even] = 1/2. 

We will simulate 1000 dice rolls and calculate what proportion of rolls are even. As the # of rolls increases, the proportion should reach our expected value, 1/2. 

We are using python Pandas to graphically visualize the Law of Large Numbers. 

#To Run the Program

    python lawlargenum.py
    
A matplotlib graph will appear. Easy as that!
